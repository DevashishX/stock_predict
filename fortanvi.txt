market: nyse or nasdaq
mean: (index) dowjones or nasdaq composite (like sensex)
#my suggestion is go for nasdaq index cause all the major companies are listed on nasdaq
#nasdaq(like bombay stocl exchange) is electronically controlled 
#while nyse is manually controlled(old style trading with paper, pen and cash)
#nasdaq also has subindexes of specific sectors
#its also possible to get means of different markets (if possible, but nasdaq is must)
#lets start with these companies
comapnies: WIKI/AAPL, WIKI/AMZN, WIKI/FB, WIKI/GOOG, WIKI/YHOO
features array format:
#keep in mind that 
#A
#mean = mean closing of the previous day, so will have to get data of n+1 days and then shift it 
#[0:n] -> [1:n+1]
#or however you want, but we will have to carry forward data for one day

columns: 1, mean, mean^2, ....., mean^10, time, time^2, ...., time^10, ..., mean*time, mean^2*time, mean*time^2,... 

target array:
different arrays of one column and many rows of opening price, closing, etc
opening, closing, peak, low
4 are enough
